# Welpurse Web Application

## Architecture Overview

### DNS Resolution
- **DNS Request**: Begins with a request to resolve "www.welpurse.com".
- **DNS Server Response**: Provides an IP address for the client to connect to.

### Server Hierarchy
- **Root Servers**: Two root servers connected to a COM TLD server.
- **COM TLD Server**: Linked to an authoritative name server.
- **Authoritative Name Server**: Connected to web monitoring tools (SOA/LOG/CDC).

### Client Interaction
- **Client**: Represented by a globe icon labeled "WWW".
- **Resolver**: Communicates with the root and COM TLD servers.

### Security and Performance
- **Cloudflare**: Ensures performance and security.
- **SSL Encryption**: Involves a CA server for secure data transmission.

### Server Infrastructure
- **Web Servers**: Three servers for redundancy and load distribution.
- **Application Server**: Powered by DocumentDB and Python.
- **Database**: Central database connected to web server configurations.

This architecture is designed for high traffic volumes, providing resilience and scalability. It includes Cloudflare for enhanced performance and security, and web monitoring tools for system health.
